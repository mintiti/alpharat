# SymmetricMLP training configuration
# Usage: uv run python scripts/train_and_benchmark_symmetric.py configs/train_symmetric.yaml
#
# SymmetricMLP uses DeepSet architecture for structural P1/P2 symmetry.
# No player swap augmentation needed - symmetry is guaranteed by weight sharing.

model:
  hidden_dim: 256
  dropout: 0.0

optim:
  lr: 1e-3
  policy_weight: 1.0
  value_weight: 1.0
  # Nash consistency loss: enforces game-theoretic consistency between payout and policy
  # - nash_weight: loss weight (0 = disabled)
  # - nash_mode: "target" uses MCTS policies, "predicted" uses NN's own policies
  #   "predicted" acts as self-consistency regularization between policy and payout heads
  nash_weight: 1.0
  nash_mode: predicted
  # Constant-sum regularization: encourages P1 + P2 payouts ≈ total cheese collected
  # PyRat is approximately constant-sum; this pushes all action pairs toward same sum
